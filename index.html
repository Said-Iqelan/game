If the author has set “Written response”, to resolve a point you have to click on it, write their name and click on “Check”.</p><p>If the author has set a maximum time or a limit on the number of lives, you have to finish the game before the time and/or lives run out.</p><p>If there are a certain number of lives, you lose one every time you make a mistake identifying a point.</p><p>The game ends when you have seen and/or solved all the points on the map.</p><h2>Controls</h2><h3>Cellphone or Tablet</h3><p>In Explore mode, tap any point to view its information, or use the “Start” or “Next” buttons to move from one to the other. When you have seen them all, click on the “Finish” button to finish the game.</p><p>In Play mode, click on the point that corresponds to the content of the heading to solve it. Once a point has been resolved, press on the “Next” button or anywhere on the screen to continue playing. When you solve the last point, press on the “Finish” button or anywhere on the screen to finish the game.</p><p>If the author has activated the “Written response” option, the points are resolved by pressing on them, writing their name and pressing on “Check”.</p><p>In any of the modes, if you have resolved a point or have opened one that was already resolved, press anywhere on the map or the “Next” button to close the information window. You can also do this by pressing on the end of the tab or moving it as if to fold it.</p><p>Swipe the map image to scroll through it. Pinch and unpinch with two fingers to zoom in and out, respectively. Press the “Full View” button at any time to see the entire map.</p><p>Press on an image of the heading to enlarge it, or on the Play/Pause button to play or pause the audio.</p><h3>Computer</h3><p>In Explore mode, click on any point to view its information, or use the “Start” or “Next” buttons to move from one to the other. When you have seen them all, click on the “Finish” button to finish the game.</p><p>In Play mode, click on the point that corresponds to the content of the statement to solve it. Once a point has been resolved, click on the “Next” button or anywhere on the screen to continue playing. When you solve the last point, click on the “End” button or anywhere on the screen to finish the game.</p><p>If the author has activated the “Written response” option, the points are resolved by clicking on them, writing their name and clicking on “Check”.</p><p>In any of the modes, if you have resolved a point or have opened one that was already resolved, click anywhere on the map or the “Next” button to close the information window. You can also do this by clicking on the end of the tab or moving it as if to fold it.</p><p>Click and drag the map on the image to move around it. Use the “+” and “-” buttons or the mouse wheel to zoom in and out, respectively. Click the “Full View” button at any time to see the entire map.</p><p>Click on an image of the heading to enlarge it, or on the Play/Pause button to play or pause the audio.</p><h2>Score</h2><p>In Explore mode, you get a score of 100 whenever you finish the game, after having seen the information in all the points.</p><p>In Play mode, you start with a score of 0 and earn up to 100 depending on how many points you resolve correctly.</p><p>The total score is divided by the number of points on the map. For example, if there are 10 points on the map, each of them adds up to 10.</p><p>When you make a mistake on a point, the maximum score you can get on that point is halved. The second time, it is divided by four, and the third time, the score for that point is zero.</p>","audio_track":"Audio file","submit":"Check","next":"Next","continue":"Continue","finish":"Finish","specificPoint":"Press on the corresponding point","point":"Points"}
